## Send TLS emails

You can see how to send (text) email, or a text email with an attachment.  Easiest
way to see how it works is look at the 'TestSend' code under /src/test/java.  Note: You'll
need to setup property file for the 'source' mail account, take a look at the emailExample.properties
in the resources directory.
